# tubearchivist-custom-style
Custom css style for tube archivist, light theme with greenish accent, a little bit more modern than the stock theme.

***DISCLAIMER**: I'm by not by any mean a proffisional web-developer, I just couldn't find a pleasening theme for tubearchivist than the stock ones, so had to create this one.*

So here it is, custom.css theme you can throw in your tubearchivist installation and modify it as you like.

## Installation
Refer to [https://docs.tubearchivist.com/configuration/stylesheets/]

**Note:** Login screen doesn't load custom.css om login screen, it defaults to dark.css, so I found it easier to replace dark.css directly via the docker bind mount

## Preview
*Preview may show some miscoloring and other artifacts due to gif encoder..*
